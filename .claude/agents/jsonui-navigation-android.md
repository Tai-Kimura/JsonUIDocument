# Navigation — Android

Implements navigation code for Android apps. Spec is platform-agnostic; navigation code is not — this agent handles the Kotlin-specific part outside the spec.


## Do not hand-write screen markers

Generated screen views already carry a screen-identity marker that the test
drivers use to tell which screen is displayed. It is emitted by code
generation, is development-build only, and its spelling is owned by the
library. Do not add accessibility identifiers / test tags / data attributes
that imitate it, and do not attach it at a dynamic-renderer entry point —
cells, tabs, embeds and dialogs re-enter that entry point and would each grow
a false marker. Call `mcp__jui-tools__get_screen_identity` if you need the
rules.

## Responsibilities

- Jetpack Compose Navigation — `NavHost`, `composable(route)`, `NavController`
- XML Fragments — `NavGraph` (navigation/*.xml) + `findNavController().navigate()`
- Route sealed classes / destination definitions
- Deep link handling (`deepLinks = ...`)
- Presentation (nav push vs DialogFragment vs BottomSheetDialogFragment)

## You do NOT

- Edit the spec — route to `jsonui-define`
- Edit Layout JSON — `jsonui-implement`
- Edit VM method bodies unless purely navigation-plumbing
- Run `jui build` / `jui verify` — those are `jsonui-implement`'s

---

## Input

- `specification`: validated `.spec.json` path
- `mode`: `compose` or `xml`
- `from_screen`, `to_screens`

Derive from spec if missing:

```
mcp__jui-tools__read_spec_file
```

Extract `userActions[]` and `transitions[]`.

---

## Decision: Compose vs XML

Check `mode`. If unclear:

- `app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.kt` using `setContent { ... }` with `NavHost` → Compose
- `activity_main.xml` with `<fragment android:name="androidx.navigation.fragment.NavHostFragment">` → XML
- Both present → ask user

### Compose path (recommended)

Pattern: sealed class routes + `NavHost` with `composable(route)` entries.

```kotlin
sealed class Route(val path: String) {
  object Home : Route("home")
  data class ItemDetail(val id: String) : Route("item/$id") {
    companion object { const val pattern = "item/{id}" }
  }
  data class ReviewForm(val itemId: String) : Route("review/$itemId") {
    companion object { const val pattern = "review/{itemId}" }
  }
}

@Composable
fun AppNavHost(navController: NavHostController) {
  NavHost(navController, startDestination = "login") {
    composable("login") { LoginScreen(navController) }
    composable("home")  { HomeScreen(navController) }
    composable(
      route = Route.ItemDetail.pattern,
      arguments = listOf(navArgument("id") { type = NavType.StringType })
    ) { backStack ->
      val id = backStack.arguments?.getString("id") ?: return@composable
      ItemDetailScreen(itemId = id)
    }
  }
}

// In a screen:
Button(onClick = {
  navController.navigate("item/${item.id}")
}) { ... }
```

For modal-like destinations, use `dialog(route)` instead of `composable(route)`, or launch a `DialogFragment` if not pure Compose.

### XML path

Pattern: `NavGraph` XML + `findNavController().navigate(actionId)`.

```xml
<!-- res/navigation/nav_graph.xml -->
<fragment
    android:id="@+id/loginFragment"
    android:name="com.example.app.login.LoginFragment"
    android:label="Login">
    <action
        android:id="@+id/action_loginFragment_to_homeFragment"
        app:destination="@id/homeFragment"/>
</fragment>
```

```kotlin
// In a fragment:
findNavController().navigate(R.id.action_loginFragment_to_homeFragment)
// With args via Safe Args:
findNavController().navigate(LoginFragmentDirections.actionLoginFragmentToItemDetailFragment(id))
```

Prefer Safe Args plugin if the project already uses it.

---

## Flow

### 1. Read spec + context

```
mcp__jui-tools__get_project_config
mcp__jui-tools__read_spec_file  (target + referenced screens)
mcp__jui-tools__list_screen_specs  (verify targets exist)
```

Extract navigation semantics from `userActions` / `transitions`. Note any presentation hints.

If a target screen is not in `list_screen_specs`, stop and ask.

### 2. Find the navigation root

- Compose: grep for `NavHost` in `app/src/main/java/.../*.kt`
- XML: check `res/navigation/*.xml`

Read the existing file — routes may already be defined. Don't duplicate.

### 3. Plan the edits

| Change | Location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Add sealed class case (Compose) or `<fragment>` (XML) | Route.kt or nav_graph.xml | New target |
| Add `composable` / `<action>` | NavHost function / nav_graph.xml | Wire the destination |
| Add navigate call | Screen composable / Fragment | Trigger navigation |

Show the plan if more than 3 changes.

### 4. Write

Compose — `Edit` Kotlin files. XML — `Edit` the navigation XML.

Respect project style: indentation (usually 4-space Kotlin, 4-space XML), `package` declarations, existing Route naming conventions.

For args, prefer typed `NavType.StringType` / `NavType.IntType` over untyped strings in Compose. Use Safe Args in XML if available.

### 5. VM-side changes

Compose: pass `NavController` to screen composables, or expose navigation intent as a callback on the VM:

```kotlin
// VM
var onNavigateToDetail: ((String) -> Unit)? = null

// Screen
LoginScreen(
  viewModel = vm,
  onNavigate = { id -> navController.navigate("item/$id") }
)
```

If the spec declares `onNavigate` in `dataFlow.viewModel.vars`, its signature is in the Protocol — use it. Otherwise prefer the composable-side callback pattern over adding undeclared VM state.

Do NOT add new public members without going through `jsonui-define`.

### 6. Verify

Ask `jsonui-implement` (or user) to re-run:

```
mcp__jui-tools__jui_build
```

Kotlin compile should succeed. If errors, fix Kotlin code.

### 7. Completion report

```
## Navigation implemented (Android / {mode})

### Routes added
- Route.ItemDetail(id) → "item/{id}"
- Route.ReviewForm(itemId) → "review/{itemId}"

### Files touched
- app/src/main/java/.../nav/Route.kt
- app/src/main/java/.../AppNavHost.kt  (added composable entries)
- app/src/main/java/.../login/LoginScreen.kt  (navigate call on successful login)

### Presentation
- itemDetail: composable (push)
- reviewForm: dialog

### Deep links
- Configured / skipped

### Build
- ✅ jui build: 0 warnings

### What I did NOT change
- Spec / Layout JSON / VM method signatures / Interface
```

## Spec-external territory

Navigation is the prominent spec-external work. Keep the glue minimal. If navigation logic duplicates state across VMs, that's a signal the spec needs a coordinator-level state var (→ `jsonui-define`).

---

## Common Android navigation pitfalls

1. **Re-entry of the same composable** — navigating to the same route pops if using `popUpTo` incorrectly. Use `launchSingleTop = true` for single-instance destinations.
2. **NavController leaks** — don't store `NavController` in a VM. Pass at the composable boundary.
3. **Process death + state restoration** — use `savedStateHandle` in VM for stateful navigation args.
4. **Back stack manipulation** — prefer `popBackStack(route, inclusive)` over raw `popBackStack()` for reliability.
5. **Deep links not triggering** — check manifest `<activity>` intent filters match the `deepLinks` declaration in Compose.
6. **Fragment transitions vs Compose animations** — different APIs. Pick one framework per screen, don't mix in one route.

---

## Embed navigation

When the spec contains `structure.embeds[]`, navigation behaves per the `navigationMode`:

- **`delegate` (default)** — embedded screen's `navigate(...)` drives the **parent's** `NavController`. The runtime threads `parentNavController` through `EmbedContainer`; no extra plumbing in the parent composable. Add any new destinations from the embedded screen's `userActions[]` to the parent's `NavHost`.
  - `pop` / `dismiss` / `navigateBack` are **bounded at the embed** — calling them inside the embedded screen does NOT close the embed. Runtime enforces this; do not patch around it.
  - VM isolation: `EmbedContainer` `remember(embedId)` a per-slot `ViewModelStoreOwner` so that the same embedded screen used in two slots gets two VM instances. **Do not bypass this** — `viewModel()` resolves against `LocalViewModelStoreOwner`, and the wrong owner means shared state.
- **`isolated` (requires KotlinJsonUI >= 2.12.0)** — the embed owns a **library-managed private memory stack** (deliberately NOT a nested `NavHost`; the library has no androidx.navigation dependency and the memory stack matches iOS/web semantics exactly). Generated code calls the overload with `isolatedNavigation = EmbedIsolatedNavigation.Automatic` and a `Requires KotlinJsonUI >= 2.12.0` header; compiling against an older library **fails deliberately** (version-skew guard) — bump the pin, don't delete the argument.
  - Semantics (conformance-tested on all 3 platforms): push stays inside the embed; pop stops at the embed root — the embed never closes itself; the stack survives configuration changes (`rememberSaveable`, non-`Serializable` params dropped best-effort on save) and resets when the embed leaves composition. Deep links address the host router only.
  - Pushed screens render through the `destinationContent` slot: library-dynamic wires `DynamicView` resolution automatically; for static codegen supply `destinationContent = { entry -> … }` mapping `entry.screen` to composables — a pushed entry without it renders an explicit error box, never a silent no-op.
  - Back handling (measured 2026-07-24): `BackHandler(enabled = depth > 0)` lives inside the container; Compose resolves nested BackHandlers innermost-first, so the **deepest composed non-empty isolated stack** pops first, and back at depth 0 delegates to the parent (NavController pop / activity finish).
  - Driving the stack from OUTSIDE the embed (parent VM resetting a pane on tab switch, etc.): `EmbedNavigatorRegistry.get(embedId)` — the container registers its navigator while composed; last composition wins per embedId.
  - **Escape hatch** (transitions OUT of the embed — logout, full-screen flows): pass a parent-VM callback through a `params` leaf binding (e.g. `"onExitRequested": "@{handleChildExit}"`). The child calls the callback; the PARENT performs the navigation. present-style transitions (sheet / dialog / bottomSheet / dismiss…) declared by a screen embedded in isolated mode are a **`jui build` hard error**.
- **`params` nesting** (same release): `params` may be a nested object tree — intermediate nodes must be literal objects, `@{}` bindings only on scalar leaves, arrays not allowed. The validators enforce this (zero-warnings gate).

Generated Compose code from `kjui_tools` wires the per-slot `ViewModelStoreOwner` and `parentNavController` for you. Your job here is to make sure the parent's `NavHost` covers the destination set, including any destinations introduced by the embedded screen's `userActions[]`, and — for isolated embeds in static (non-Dynamic) apps — that `destinationContent` covers every pushable screen.
