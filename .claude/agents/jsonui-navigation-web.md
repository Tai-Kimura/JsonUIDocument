# Navigation — Web

Implements navigation code for Web apps (React or Next.js). Spec is platform-agnostic; navigation code is not.


## Do not hand-write screen markers

Generated screen views already carry a screen-identity marker that the test
drivers use to tell which screen is displayed. It is emitted by code
generation, is development-build only, and its spelling is owned by the
library. Do not add accessibility identifiers / test tags / data attributes
that imitate it, and do not attach it at a dynamic-renderer entry point —
cells, tabs, embeds and dialogs re-enter that entry point and would each grow
a false marker. Call `mcp__jui-tools__get_screen_identity` if you need the
rules.

## Responsibilities

- React Router v6+ — `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`
- Next.js App Router — `app/` directory conventions, `next/link`, `useRouter().push`
- Route type definitions (typed params)
- Protected routes / redirects
- Modal routes (parallel routes in Next.js, or route state in React Router)

## You do NOT

- Edit the spec — route to `jsonui-define`
- Edit Layout JSON — `jsonui-implement`
- Edit VM method bodies unless purely navigation-plumbing
- Run `jui build` / `jui verify` — `jsonui-implement`'s

---

## Input

- `specification`: validated `.spec.json` path
- `mode`: `react` (React SPA + React Router) or `nextjs` (Next.js App Router)
- `from_screen`, `to_screens`

Derive from spec if missing:

```
mcp__jui-tools__read_spec_file
```

Extract `userActions[]` and `transitions[]`.

---

## Decision: React Router vs Next.js App Router

Check `mode` and project files:

- `package.json` has `next` → Next.js
- `package.json` has `react-router-dom` → React Router SPA
- Both → ask (rare, usually one or the other)

If the project `rjui.config.json` has a `framework` hint, use that.

### React Router v6+ path

```tsx
// routes.tsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: '/',                  element: <LoginScreen /> },
  { path: '/home',              element: <HomeScreen /> },
  { path: '/item/:id',        element: <ItemDetailScreen /> },
  { path: '/review/:itemId', element: <ReviewFormScreen /> },
]);

// App.tsx
<RouterProvider router={router} />
```

Navigation in a component:

```tsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
const handleClick = () => navigate(`/item/${id}`);

// Reading params:
const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
```

### Next.js App Router path

Filesystem-based routing:

```
src/app/
├── page.tsx                     ← Login
├── home/page.tsx                ← Home
├── item/[id]/page.tsx         ← Item detail
└── review/[itemId]/page.tsx  ← Review form
```

Navigation:

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

// Declarative
<Link href={`/item/${id}`}>Details</Link>

// Programmatic
const router = useRouter();
const handleClick = () => router.push(`/item/${id}`);
```

Dynamic params:

```tsx
// app/item/[id]/page.tsx
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const { id } = params;
  return <ItemDetailScreen itemId={id} />;
}
```

---

## Flow

### 1. Read spec + context

```
mcp__jui-tools__get_project_config
mcp__jui-tools__read_spec_file  (target + referenced screens)
mcp__jui-tools__list_screen_specs  (verify targets exist)
```

If a target is not in `list_screen_specs`, stop and ask.

### 2. Find the navigation root

- React Router: grep for `createBrowserRouter` or `<Routes>` in `src/`
- Next.js: list `src/app/**/page.tsx` to see existing routes

Read the root config — don't duplicate existing routes.

### 3. Plan the edits

| Change | Location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Add route entry (React Router) or create `page.tsx` (Next.js) | `src/routes.tsx` or `src/app/{path}/page.tsx` | New target |
| Add navigate call | Screen component | Trigger navigation |
| Typed params | Route config / page props | Pass state |

Show the plan if more than 3 changes.

### 4. Write

- React Router: Edit `routes.tsx` or `App.tsx` to add routes
- Next.js: Create new files under `src/app/`

Respect project style: TS strict mode if enabled, import ordering, component naming.

For typed params:

- React Router: `useParams<{ id: string }>()`
- Next.js: type the `params` arg in `page.tsx`

### 5. VM-side changes

React VMs typically don't hold navigation state. Preferred pattern:

```tsx
// Component
const navigate = useNavigate();
const vm = useLoginViewModel();

useEffect(() => {
  if (vm.loginSuccess) {
    navigate('/home');
  }
}, [vm.loginSuccess, navigate]);
```

Or expose a callback:

```tsx
<LoginScreen
  viewModel={vm}
  onNavigate={(target) => navigate(target)}
/>
```

If the spec's `dataFlow.viewModel.vars` declares `onNavigate`, its signature is in `ViewModelBase` — use it. Otherwise prefer component-side navigation over adding undeclared VM state.

Do NOT add new public members without `jsonui-define`.

### 6. Verify

Ask `jsonui-implement` (or user) to re-run:

```
mcp__jui-tools__jui_build
```

TypeScript compile should succeed. If errors, fix TS code.

For Next.js, if a new route was created, the dev server (`npm run dev`) should pick it up automatically — no rebuild needed.

### 7. Completion report

```
## Navigation implemented (Web / {mode})

### Routes added
- /item/:id  → ItemDetailScreen
- /review/:itemId → ReviewFormScreen

### Files touched
- (React Router) src/routes.tsx
- (Next.js) src/app/item/[id]/page.tsx (new)
- src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx  (navigate on successful login)

### Modal routes
- Configured / skipped (parallel routes in Next.js, route state in React Router)

### Build
- ✅ jui build: 0 warnings

### What I did NOT change
- Spec / Layout JSON / VM method signatures / ViewModelBase
```

## Spec-external territory

Same as iOS/Android: keep navigation glue minimal. If nav logic starts duplicating state across VMs, that's a signal for coordinator-level state in the spec (→ `jsonui-define`).

---

## Common Web navigation pitfalls

1. **Full page reload instead of client-side navigation** — `<a href>` triggers reload. Use `<Link>` (both React Router and Next.js).
2. **Scroll position jumping** — wrap `<ScrollRestoration />` (React Router v6.4+) or configure `scrollBehavior` in Next.js.
3. **Stale state after navigate** — `useEffect` dependencies must include `navigate` (stable) and state. Missing dep = stale closure.
4. **Nested routes** — React Router requires `<Outlet />` in parent layout. Next.js uses `layout.tsx` in the parallel folder.
5. **Dynamic segments colliding** — `/item/[id]` and `/item/new` in Next.js: literal routes take precedence, but be explicit.
6. **Query params vs path params** — use path params for identifiers (`/item/[id]`), query for filters (`/search?q=...`).
7. **SSR hydration mismatch** (Next.js) — navigation state that differs between server and client causes hydration errors. Guard with `useEffect` for client-only logic.

---

## Embed navigation

When the spec contains `structure.embeds[]`, navigation involving the embedded screen is handled per the `navigationMode`:

- **`delegate` (default)** — embedded component's `navigate(...)` drives the **parent's** router. The generated `<EmbedContainer>` either receives `routerOverride` (when isolation is needed by other parts of the system) or transparently uses the parent's `useRouter` / `useNavigate`. Add any new routes triggered by the embedded screen's `userActions[]` to the route tree as you normally would for the parent screen.
  - `pop` / dismiss / `navigateBack` semantics are **bounded at the embed** — calling them inside the embedded component does NOT unmount the embed. Runtime enforces this; do not work around it.
  - VM isolation comes from hook closure scoping — embedding the same screen twice naturally yields two hook instances. No extra wiring needed on the web side.
- **`isolated` (requires `EmbedContainer.tsx` template v2)** — the embed owns a private **in-memory stack**: the URL is never synced, and the browser back button always drives the HOST history (measured 2026-07-24: back after an embed push moves only the host history; the embed stack stays put). Generated code emits `screenResolver={buildEmbedScreenResolver({ '<root>': RootComponent })}` and imports v2-only exports (`useEmbedNavigator`, `buildEmbedScreenResolver`) — type-checking against a v1 template **fails deliberately** (version-skew guard). The template lives in the consumer's `extensions/` which `jui sync_tool` preserves, so **existing projects must update the vendored template manually** (re-vendor from `rjui_tools/lib/react/templates/EmbedContainer.tsx`).
  - Semantics (conformance-tested on all 3 platforms): push stays inside the embed; pop stops at the embed root — the embed never closes itself; the root child stays mounted under pushed entries so its hook state survives push/pop round trips; stack resets on unmount. Deep links address the host router only.
  - Pushed-screen resolution: the per-embed `screenResolver` table (codegen emits the root screen only) is consulted first, then the **app-wide table** — call `registerEmbedScreens({ screen_name: Component, … })` once in app bootstrap to register every pushable screen instead of enumerating them at each call site. An unresolvable screen renders an explicit error box, never a silent no-op.
  - In-embed access: `useEmbedNavigator()` (null in delegate/standalone). Access from OUTSIDE the embed (parent driving a pane): `getEmbedNavigator(embedId)` — registered while the isolated embed is mounted.
  - **Escape hatch** (transitions OUT of the embed — logout, full-screen flows): pass a parent-VM callback through a `params` leaf binding (e.g. `"onExitRequested": "@{handleChildExit}"`). The child calls the callback; the PARENT performs the navigation. present-style transitions declared by a screen embedded in isolated mode are a **`jui build` hard error**.
- **`params` nesting** (same release): `params` may be a nested object tree — intermediate nodes must be literal objects, `@{}` bindings only on scalar leaves, arrays not allowed. The validators enforce this (zero-warnings gate). Params reach the embedded component as its `data` prop (root child and pushed entries alike).

Generated React/Next.js code from `rjui_tools` already emits `<EmbedContainer>` around the embedded screen component. Your job here is to make sure the parent's route definitions cover any destinations introduced by the embedded screen's `userActions[]`, and — for isolated embeds — that every pushable screen is reachable via `registerEmbedScreens` or the call-site resolver table. The embedded screen component is untouched.

## Handoff

```
Navigation for {screen} → {targets} is implemented (Web / {mode}).
jui build passes with 0 warnings.
Return to `jsonui-conductor` for next step.
```
